# Mc-Auth
Use your Minecraft account to easily log in, without giving your password or email to some random website!
Thanks to Mc-Auth, you can securely log in to third-party services without providing your sensitive data to Mc-Auth!

It aims to be highly transparent to users **and** developers.
Thanks to this transparency, it is easily compliant with most data protection laws
e.g. the **[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)**.

### Another Authentication Service for Minecraft? Really?
I know there is *[minecraft.id](https://minecraft.id/) by inventivetalent* or
*[Minecraft oAuth](https://mc-oauth.net/) by Deftware* (and some more),
but I had something different in mind for my project [SkinDB.net](https://github.com/SkinDB).
They look nice and get the job done, but are lacking information about how your data is treated (e.g. GDPR compliant?).
Another feature I missed was full oAuth2 implementation.
What would normally be done by Mojang as account holders, but they didn't (until now).

So I started reading [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) to understand how oAuth2 works
and has to be implemented => Mc-Auth.com was born!

## How to use Mc-Auth?
If you are a developer, you can check [the documentation](https://github.com/Mc-Auth-com/Mc-Auth/wiki) and find out
more about using Mc-Auth.

If you are a normal Minecraft player and a website or application you are using might find this interesting,
feel free to contact them with a link to this project ‚Äì While making the Minecraft Community a safer place!


## Setup
Some npm scripts exist for convenience:
* `build`: Builds the project for production
* `build:dev`: Builds the project for development (includes source maps)

* `dev`: Builds and starts the project while watches for file changes to automatically restart
* `test`: Runs the tests

* `snyk`: Uses *snyk* to check the source code for vulnerabilities
* `snyk:docker`: Uses *snyk* to check the production Docker image for vulnerabilities

* `docker:build:prod`: Builds the production Docker image
* `docker:build:dev`: Builds the development Docker image
* `docker:dev`: Builds and starts the development Docker image (container uses host network and mounts local `./storage/` directory)

### Development
You'll need at least Node.js v16 and Linux/Bash is recommended (my npm scripts expect bash).
Additionally, you'll need a PostgreSQL instance
([a local docker container might be an option](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/postgres#start-a-postgres-instance)).

Configuration is done inside `./storage/` and interesting npm scripts are `dev`, `build:dev` and `docker:dev`.


## Production
* Please prepare your database by running `./database-setup.sql`
* When you are done, visit
  [Mc-Auth-com/McAuth-BungeeCord](https://github.com/Mc-Auth-com/McAuth-BungeeCord#setup)
  and continue by setting it up too

1. Run `npm run docker:build:prod` (no `npm install` needed)
2. Start the container with something similar to:
   ```shell
   docker run \
   --detach \
   --name mc-auth-web \
   --publish 8080:8080 \
   --volume mc-auth-web-storage:/app/storage/ \
   --volume mc-auth-web-logs:/app/logs/ \
   --cpus 2 \
   --memory 256M \
   --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
   --read-only \
   mc-auth-web:latest
   ```
3. Edit the configuration inside the container at `/app/storage/`


Or without docker:
1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run build`
3. `node ./dist/index.js`
4. Edit the configuration inside `./storage/`
